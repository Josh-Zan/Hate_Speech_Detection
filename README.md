# Hate_Speech_Detection
# Abstract
Hate speech is a subject of worry for online platforms. With powerfully expanding datasets manual mediation of posts is very inconceivable or will be tedious. Hate speech detection should be an automated task to distinguish hate speech from the provided input. In this work, a deep learning model multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) is implemented. The model consists of 3 channels of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Each channel is merged and connected to a fully connected layer from where the final output is obtained.
